# Bikesharing Analysis
## Purpose of our analysis
The purpose of our analysis was to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid bussiness proposal. We did this through creating different graphs. One of the graphs showed the amount of time users rented the bikes. Moreover, we showed the gender breakdown of the users, the checkout time by gender, Number of trips during the week by gender, a clear breakdown of customers and subscribers during the week and lastly by creating a graph that shows the number of bikes that require repairs.
## Results of the Analysis
### Checkout times for users

The graph shows the number of bikes which were rented for a certain period of time. From this graph we determine that most bikes were rented for 20 minutes and as the time increased, the number of bikes that are rented decreased
### Gender Breakdown

The pie chart shows us the breakdown of the genders which tells us that most bikes were rented by males
### Checkout time by Gender

The graph tells us the number of bikes that were rented by each gender and also tells the amount of time the bikes were rented for
### Trips by weekday per hour

The graph breaks down the bike rentals per hour for every day of the week. It's clear that most bikes are shared either early in the morning or after work is done
### Trips by gender per hour

The graph shows the number of bikes that were shared during the week for each hour filtered by gender. We learn that there are a higher number of males that use the ride sharing program during 7 am - 9 am and also during 5 pm to 7 pm during the weekday than the other genders
### User trips by gender

The graph shows the number of subscribers and customers broken down by gender for each day of the week. From the graoh we learn that the highest number of subscribers for every day of the week are men
### Bike Repairs

The graph tells us which bikes had the most trips that might require repairs soon

## Summary of the results
Looking at the graphs, its fair to say that more males are part of the ride sharing program compared to other genders. Also, there are a greater number of subscribers from the gender male compared to the other genders. There are peak hours when the ride sharing program is used a lot during the week. These hours are early morning and after work. Another visualization that can be looked at could be just for the peak hours. Such a visualization could show the specific times during the peak hours when the ride sharing program is used the most. Another visualization that we can do could be done for the distance from the start station to the end station to find the routes with the highest distance. Once we know off these distances, we can assign the bikes with the lowest bike sharing hours for these routes to prevent the overworking of bikes that already have high bike sharing hours
